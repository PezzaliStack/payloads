# 🧠 PezzaliStack Payloads

Welcome to the `payloads/` directory of **PezzaliStack** — a curated collection of offensive and defensive payloads for red teaming, penetration testing, and educational cybersecurity research.

## 📁 Structure

Each payload is organized in its own folder, usually containing:

- `payload.txt` – Main DuckyScript or command-based payload
- `README.md` – Payload description and usage details
- `inject.bin` – Compiled binary (optional)
- `LICENSE` – Applicable license if needed
## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a platform to share and showcase creative payloads that can be used in:

- Cybersecurity training environments
- Red team simulations
- Educational demos
- Research on data exfiltration, access, and automation

All payloads are designed to be modular, adaptable, and easy to understand.

## ✅ Ethical Use
